      description: 'In college, I studied Mechanical Engineering, but I always loved my coding classes the most. Instead of applying code to hardware, I decided to make a switch and learn how to apply my coding skills on the web development side. I joined Spoon University initially and have since transitioned to other Discovery brands, primarily Food Network. I am continuing to learn and grow every day, knowing I made the right choice.'

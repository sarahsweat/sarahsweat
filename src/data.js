      description: ['In college, I studied Mechanical Engineering, but I always loved my coding classes the most. Instead of applying code to hardware, I decided to make a switch and learn how to apply my coding skills on the web development side. I moved to New York and graduated from Flatiron Schools Web Development Immersive program. I joined Spoon University after that and have since transitioned to other Discovery brands, primarily Food Network. I am continuing to learn and grow every day in this, knowing I made the right switch.']
